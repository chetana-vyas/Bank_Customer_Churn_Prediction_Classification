# Project Proposal

## Predicting Churn for Bank Customers

## Purpose:
Customer acquisition is an expensive process, requires huge effort than retention. Most giants in tech / non-tech sector is working on a crucial goal of reducing customer churn.
I want to build a classification model to predict the Customer Churn rate for Bank Customers

## Goal:
Accurately predict the Churn rate for Bank Customers

## Data Description:

•  [kaggle dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/kmalit/bank-customer-churn-prediction/data)

### Target
Exited : 0/1 for non-exited/exited

### Features

* CreditScore
* Geography	
* Gender
* Age
* Tenure
* Balance
* Number Of Products
* Has Credit Card
* Is Active Member
* Estimated Salary

## Algorithms:
I will use Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc; improve the baseline model and tune the hyperparameters

## Tools:

Python packages for building the model –
1.	Scikit-learn – build Classification model
2.	Pandas – manipulating and working on data frames
3.	NumPy – working with arrays
4.	matplotlib and seaborn – data visualization
	
## MVP Goal:
Show the Consumer Churn rate prediction baseline model with performance metrics
